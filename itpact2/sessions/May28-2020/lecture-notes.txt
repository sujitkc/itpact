Today, we learned about if-elif-else way of writing multibranch decisions.
We saw the elif is a "syntactic sugar" over if-else if, i.e. using it, 
there's no extra functionality that we can implement that we can't using
if-else if branches. However, we all agreed that elifs make the programs
more readable. And this is important.

We then learned looping, a new control-flow construct which allows us to
write algorithms where the same instruction is executed repeatedly to 
achieve desirable effects.

We also learned about 'break' which allows us to terminate execution of a
loop whenever we want.

We finished our discussion with a short discussion on booleans which is
a very important data type. In fact, without them it would have been 
impossible to write programs involving decisions: i.e. branching and/or loops.
