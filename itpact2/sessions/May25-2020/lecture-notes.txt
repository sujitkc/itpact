We learned the following today:
- Operators can have mixed types of operands
  For example: in "ITPACT" * 5, * takes "ITPACT" (a string) and 5 (an integer)
  and gives as a result another string. We saw many other examples too. 
- We saw an example of how such operators can be used to implement interesting
  programs (banner.py).
- Algorithm: A step by step method of instructing the computer to carry out a
  computation. We saw two real life examples of opening the door. 
- We learned that certain algorithm require decision making capability (e.g. if
  the door is locked) to write.
- If branch instruction which allows us to add decision-making as part of programs.

Additionally, we learned:
- Importance of precise instructions when writing computer programs
We saw this funny video:

- Errors अच्छे हैं! (Errors are good!) 
- We learned that it's not at all bad if your programs encounter errors.
  They are the computer's way to tell you where your program is going wrong and
  how you can fix your bugs. You should learn to read the error messages 
  carefully and make corrections in your program.
- We also pointed out some common errors new students make while writing their
  first programs involving branches. For example:
  * Forgetting to add the colon at the end of the if clause line.
  * Uneven indentation of statements within a block.
